    An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects,
    as specified in the infusion's description.
    If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself
    to it the instant you infuse the item.
    If you decide to attune to the item later,
    you must do so using the normal process for attunement

    Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely,
    but when you die, the infusion vanishes after
    a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier
    (minimum of 1 day).
    The infusion also vanishes if you replace your knowledge of
    the infusion

    You can infuse more than one nonmagical object
    at the end of a long rest.
    You must touch each of the objects,
    and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time.
    Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your
    infusions at a time.
    If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions,
    the oldest infusion ends, and then the new infusion applies.

    If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things,
    like a bag of holding, its contents  harmlessly appear in and around
    its space.

  ability("Replicate Item:\nBag of Holding")[

    The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents.
    Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.

    it ruptures and is destroyed,
    and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane.
    If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed.
    Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive
    up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided
    by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute),
    after which time they begin to suffocate.

    Placing a bag of holding inside an extra-dimensional space
    created by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item
    instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.
    The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other.
    Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it
    to a random location on the Astral Plane.
    The gate then closes.
    The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.
