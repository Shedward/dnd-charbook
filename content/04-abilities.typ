= Build for success
Autognome

You can add a d4 to one attack roll, ability check,
or saving throw you make,
and you can do so after seeing the d20 roll
but before the effects of the roll are resolved.
You can use this trait a number of times
equal to your proficiency bonus,
and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

= Healing machine
Autognome

If the Mending spell is cast on you,
you can spend a Hit Dice, roll it,
and regain a number of hit points
equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier
(minimum of 1 hit point).
In addition, your creator designed you
to benefit from several spells that preserve life
but that normally don't affect Constructs:
Cure Wounds, Healing Word, Mass Cure Wounds,
Mass Healing Word, and Spare the Dying.
